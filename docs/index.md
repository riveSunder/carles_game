## An Open-Ended Challenge in Simple Complexity, Exploration, and Machine Creativity

Carle's Game is an open-ended challenge for creative machine intelligence based on the Cellular Automata Reinforcement Learning Environment ([CARLE](https://github.com/riveSunder/carle)). CARLE is a flexible, fast environment that supports arbitrary Life-like cellular automata (CA) rule sets, and the Carle's Game challenge is part of the [IEEE 2021 Conference on Games](https://ieee-cog.org/2021/). Check out the challenge guidelines in the [project README](https://github.com/riveSunder/carles_game#readme), submit an entry to the challenge by [opening an issue](https://github.com/riveSunder/carles_game/issues) and linking to your work, check out the [example](https://github.com/rivesunder/moving_in_morley) [submissions](https://github.com/rivesunder/harli_learning), join/start a [discussion](https://github.com/riveSunder/carles_game/discussions/), or just silently check out the project without ever telling anyone you were here.
